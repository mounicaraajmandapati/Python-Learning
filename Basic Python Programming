# This is about 2 datasets which are:
# A data set containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018.
# A data set containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017.

# This project is about basic exploration of datasets, cleaning,creating a dictionary 

# Task1: created function to open and explore the datasets

def explore_data(dataset, start, end, rows_and_columns=False):
    dataset_slice = dataset[start:end]    
    for row in dataset_slice:
        print(row)
        print('\n') # adds a new (empty) line after each row for blank space between rows

    if rows_and_columns:
        print('Number of rows:', len(dataset))
        print('Number of columns:', len(dataset[0]))

# This function takes in 4 arguments and slices dataset according to the arguments 
# and prints the number of rows and columns if 4th argument is TRUE.

#Using the above created function to open and explore the Google Play and App Store datasets

import pandas as pd
apple = pd.read_csv('AppleStore.csv')
google = pd.read_csv('googleplaystore.csv')
explore_data(apple,0,100,TRUE)
explore_data(google,0,100,TRUE)

# Task 2: Basic data cleaning like deleting incorrect records and indetifying duplicate records
#On exploring records from above function, the record with index 15 is found to be incorrect.So, it should be deleted.

del apple[15]

#Identifying duplicate records by using the below function:
duplicate_app = []
unique_app = []

for app in android:
    name = app[0]
    if name in unique_app:
       duplicate_app.append(name)
    else:
       unique_app.append(name)
print('Number of dupliate apps:',len(duplicate_app)
print('List of duplicate apps:',duplicate_app)


# Task 3: Create a dictionary where each key is a unique app name 
# and the corresponding dictionary value is the highest number of reviews of that app.
