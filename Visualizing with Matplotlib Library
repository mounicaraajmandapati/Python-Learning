# This dataset is about the job outcomes of students graduated from college between 2010 and 2012.
# The aim of this project is to visualise the earnings based on college Majors


# Importing libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Run the Jupyter magic %matplotlib inline so that plots are displayed inline ie directly below the code cell that produced it
%matplotlib inline

# Reading the recent-grads.csv into pandas and assign the resulting DataFrame to recent_grads
recent_grads = pd.read_csv('recent-grads.csv')

# Exploring data structure and summary statistics
recent_grads.head()
recent_grads.tail()
recent_grads.describe()

# Matplotlib expects that columns of values we pass in have matching lengths
# Missing values will cause matplotlib to throw errors

# Use dataframe.dropna() to remove missing values
# using shape function to keep a record of the row count before and after removing missing values
raw_data_count, raw_columns = recent_grads.shape
raw_data_count
recent_grads = recent_grads.dropna()
cleaned_data_count, cleaned_columns = recent_grads.shape

# from the previous row counts, it is observed that one record has missing values and is removed.
plt.scatter(recent_grads['Sample_size'], recent_grads['Median'])

plt.scatter(recent_grads['Women'], recent_grads['Median'])


# Do students in more popular majors make more money? - NO - Because the size and median salary scatter plot are not directly proportional
# Do students that majored in subjects that were majority female make more money? - NO - Because of not proportinality
# Is there any link between the number of full-time employees and median salary? - doesnot look like there is linear relationship from scatter plot

plt.hist(recent_grads['ShareWomen'])

# What percent of majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female? - if sharewomen > 0.5 then predominantly women,else men.
# Calculated from the array resulted from hist() which shows the count of the courses of y-axis.

plt.hist(recent_grads['Median'])
# What's the most common median salary range? -  The highest point of the histogram.

# Import scatter_matrix from the pandas.plotting module to get a scatter matrix
# A scatter matrix plot combines both scatter plots and histograms into one grid of plots 
# and allows us to explore potential relationships and distributions simultaneously.

# bar plots to compare the percentages of women (ShareWomen) from the first ten rows and last ten rows of the recent_grads dataframe
